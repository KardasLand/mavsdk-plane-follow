# Mavsdk Plane Follow
[![GPLv3 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/)

This application uses Mavsdk to follow other planes and do some other tasks such as getting telemetry data, landing/taking off, arming and offsetting the plane based on global coordinates.

My goal of this application is slowly transforming the application from executing simple commands to full fledged simple library to make lives of people who just started tinkering with mavsdk a little bit easier.
